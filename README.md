# WebSky Line Intensity Mapping

This repository contains the latest, stable version of the line intensity mapping (LIM) implementation of WebSky. These codes are based on the `limlam_mocker` package (originally written by George Stein, and later modified significantly by Dongwoo Chung, Patrick Breysse, Clara Chung and Patrick Horlaville). This implementation was forked from my branch of Patrick's CITA_LIM repo and streamlined to include just critical components. Currently, this code is being developed by Nate Carlson and Doga Tolgay to produce FIRE-informed CO mocks.
